Background Process
A background process is a computer process that runs behind the scenes without user intervention. Typical tasks for theses processes are logging, monitoring, scheduling, and user notification. On a Unix or system, a background process or job can be further identified as one whose group ID differs from its terminal group ID. This type of process is unable to receive keyboard signals from and typically will not send output to its parent terminal.
